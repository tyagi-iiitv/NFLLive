    "## Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Skiena's note, we could start our model with a linear model likes this:\n",
    "$$P(W|\\sim) = f(score,\\ time\\ left,\\ field\\ position)$$ where $\\sim$ are the given observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "Since we are going to decide whether a team is going to clear its bets, this might goes to a classification problem (**clear** and **not clear**). We could use **logistic regression** to decide what's the probability that team A is going to clear the bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lg = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()\n",
    "lg.fit(X, y) # X would be the collection of vectors of score, time_left, field_position\n",
    "             # y would be a bunch of value that clear the bet or not\n",
    "prob = predict(X_new) # get the probability\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This comes a **question**: How to decide the ground truth of each time stamp (time_left)"
